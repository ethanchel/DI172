#1 Print the following output using one line of code:
print("Hello World\n"*4, end="")

#2 Write code that calculates the result of: (99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).
print((99^3)*8)

#3Predict the output of the following code snippets: oment what is your guess, then run the code and compare
5 < 3 # False
3 == 3 # True
3 == "3" # False
"3" > 3 # Error
"Hello" == "hello" # False

#4 Create a variable called computer_brand which value is the brand name of your computer. Using the computer_brand variable, print a sentence that states the following: "I have a <computer_brand> computer."
computer_brand = "Apple"
print(f"I have an {computer_brand} computer.")

#5Create a variable called name, and set it’s value to your name.
# Create a variable called age, and set it’s value to your age.
# Create a variable called shoe_size, and set it’s value to your shoe size.
# Create a variable called info and set it’s value to an interesting sentence about yourself. The sentence must contain all the variables created in parts 1, 2, and 3.
# Have your code print the info message.
# Run your code.

name = "Ethan"
Age = 26
shoe_size = 44
info = f"Hello, my name is {name}, I am {Age} years old and my shoe size is {shoe_size}."
print(info)

# Exercise 6: A & B
# Instructions
# Create two variables, a and b.
# Each variable’s value should be a number.
# If a is bigger than b, have your code print "Hello World".

a = 5
b = 10
if a > b:
    print("Hello World")
else:
    print("Goodbye")

#7 Write code that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.


user_number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
if user_number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")

#8 Write code that asks the user for their name and determines whether or not you have the same name. Print out a funny message based on the outcome.


user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
if user_name == "Ethan":
    print("Hello, Ethan! Welcome back!")
else:
    print(f"You are not Ethan,{user_name} the police is coming for you!")

#9 Write code that will ask the user for their height in centimeters.
# If they are over 145 cm, print a message that states they are tall enough to ride.
# If they are not tall enough, print a message that says they need to grow some more to ride.

user_height = float(input("Please enter your height in cm: "))
if user_height > 145:
    print("You are tall enough to ride the rollercoaster!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you need to be taller to ride the rollercoaster.")
