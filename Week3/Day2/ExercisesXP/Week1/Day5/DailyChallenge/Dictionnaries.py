#Challenge 1
# Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position) of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).

# Key Python Topics:

# User input (input())
# Dictionaries
# Loops (for loop)
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# String manipulation
# Lists


# Instructions:
# 1. User Input:

# Ask the user to enter a word.
# Store the input word in a variable.
# 2. Creating the Dictionary:

# Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
# And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.

#     * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
#     * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
# Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
# Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
# 3. Expected Output:

# For the input “dodo”, the output should be: {"d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3]}.
# For the input “froggy”, the output should be: {"f": [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5]}.
# For the input “grapes”, the output should be: {"g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3], "e": [4], "s": [5]}.

# Get user input
word = input("Enter a word: ")
# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the indices
index_dict = {}
# Iterate through each character in the word along with its index
for index, char in enumerate(word):
    # If the character is already a key in the dictionary, append the index to the list
    if char in index_dict:
        index_dict[char].append(index)
    # If the character is not in the dictionary, create a new key-value pair
    else:
        index_dict[char] = [index]
# Print the resulting dictionary
print(index_dict)

#Challenge 2
# Goal: Create a program that prints a list of items that can be purchased with a given amount of money.
# Key Python Topics:

# Dictionaries
# Loops (for loop)
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# String manipulation (replace())
# Type conversion (int())
# Lists
# Sorting (sorted())


# Instructions:
# 1. Store Data:

# You will be provided with a dictionary (items_purchase) where the keys are the item names and the values are their prices (as strings with a dollar sign). The priority is defined by the position of the iten on the dictionary: from the most important to the less important.
# You will also be given a string (wallet) representing the amount of money you have.
# 2. Data Cleaning:

# You need to clean the dollar sign and the commas using python. Don’t hard code it.
# 3. Determining Affordable Items:

# create a list called basket and add there the items that you can buy with the money you have on the wallet
# Don’t forget to update the wallet after buying an item.
# If the basket is empty (no items can be afforded), return the string “Nothing”.
# Otherwise, print the basket list in alphabetical order.
# 4. Examples:

# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Water": "$1", "Bread": "$3", "TV": "$1,000", "Fertilizer": "$20"}
# wallet = "$300"


# The output should be: ["Bread", "Fertilizer", "Water"].

# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Apple": "$4", "Honey": "$3", "Fan": "$14", "Bananas": "$4", "Pan": "$100", "Spoon": "$2"}
# wallet = "$100"


# The output should be: ["Apple", "Bananas", "Fan", "Honey", "Spoon"].

# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Phone": "$999", "Speakers": "$300", "Laptop": "$5,000", "PC": "$1200"}
# wallet = "$1"


# The output should be: "Nothing".

# Given dictionary of items and their prices
items_purchase = {"Water": "$1", "Bread": "$3", "TV": "$1,000", "Fertilizer": "$20"}
# Given wallet amount
wallet = "$300"
# Clean the wallet string and convert to integer
wallet_amount = int(wallet.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))
# Initialize an empty list to store affordable items
basket = []
# Iterate through the items in the dictionary
for item, price in items_purchase.items():
    # Clean the price string and convert to integer
    item_price = int(price.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))
    # Check if the item can be afforded with the current wallet amount
    if item_price <= wallet_amount:
        # Add the item to the basket
        basket.append(item)
        # Deduct the item price from the wallet amount
        wallet_amount -= item_price
# Check if the basket is empty
if not basket:
    print("Nothing")
else:
